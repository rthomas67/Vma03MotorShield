# Work in progress...
The intent is for this to eventually have some usable wrapper code for a Velleman VMA03
motor shield for an Arduino Uno.

# Planned Features
* DC Motor, Bipolar Stepper Motor, and unipolar stepper motor modes.
* State Machine, and direct control modes.
* Named jumper/pin configurations.
